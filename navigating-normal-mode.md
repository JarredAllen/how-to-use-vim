# Navigating Normal Mode

This tutorial assumes that you've already read my [introduction to using vim
for beginners](./a-complete-introduction.md), or are otherwise familiar with
its concepts. Read that document first, if you haven't already.

**Work in Progresss** This document is far from complete.

### Navigating Your Document

You can move the cursor around the document using the arrow keys. However,
the arrow keys are far from the rest of the keyboard and limited in their
abilities, so vim provides other methods.

### Other ways to enter Insert Mode

Pressing `i` is only one of several ways through which you can enter insert
mode and begin typing text. Vim provides many other methods, each of which
move you into insert mode slightly differently.

### Editing the document from Insert Mode

From insert mode, you can type in text onto the document. However, normal mode
also provides powerful tools for editing documents which you can use.
