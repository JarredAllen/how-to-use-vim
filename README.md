# how-to-use-vim
Vim is a powerful tool for editing plaintext documents. However, it is far from
the most intuitive tools. Here, you can learn how to use Vim.

For this tutorial, I assume that you have no prior experience with text-editing
in a terminal and that you know only the basics of using a terminal to navigate
a machine (`ls`, `cd`, `less`, etc.).

Bear in mind, this repository is a work-in-progress. There will be more added to
this repository over time, and I may go back to improve the sections which
already exist.
